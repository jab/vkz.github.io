Corporate ladder
----------------

Since 2014
:   *Programmer* at
    [Yandex](https://company.yandex.com/)
    (Moscow, Russia).

    Officially a member of *Search Interfaces Development Infrastructure* group,
    but mostly I write backend tools that perform source to source compilation:
    parse, transform and generate code. Any given project will inevitably depend
    on: [ometajs](https://github.com/veged/ometa-js),
    [esprima](http://esprima.org/),
    [estraverse](https://github.com/estools/estraverse),
    [uglify-js](https://github.com/mishoo/UglifyJS),
    [escodegen](https://github.com/estools/escodegen),
    [xjst](https://github.com/veged/xjst). If I'm lucky and do it right frontend
    developers get to use my work and get all the credit.

2009-2011
:   *Equity Derivatives & Structured Products Sales* at
    [Renaissance Capital](https://www.rencap.com/InvestmentBanking/About/)
    (Moscow, Russia).


2007-2009
:   *EM Structured Solutions and Derivatives Sales* at
    [Barclays Capital](http://investmentbank.barclays.com/markets.html)
    (London, UK).



Projects
--------
Racket
:   *Author* of [ometa-racket](https://github.com/vkz/ometa-racket), a mostly
    complete Racket implementation of
    [OMeta](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OMeta) - OO pattern-matching language
    that extends PEGs with ability to handle left-recursive rules and match
    structured data.

    *Author* of [skish](https://github.com/vkz/skish), a mostly futile attempt at
    porting Olin Shivers' wonderful [scsh](http://scsh.net/) to Racket. scsh is
    a non-interactive Unix shell embedded within Scheme (originally Scheme48).

Clojure
:   *Author* of several closed-source FpML related products: FpML message parser,
    financial derivatives classifier based on ISDA taxonomies.

JavaScript
:   *Author* of [bemhtml-syntax](https://github.com/vkz/bemhtml-syntax), a syntax
    converter for [BEMHTML](https://en.bem.info/) - an XSLT inspired templating
    language - part of [BEM methodology](https://en.bem.info/method/) of
    frontend development.

    *Author* of
    [bemhtml-source-convert](https://github.com/vkz/bemhtml-source-convert), a
    *best effort* compiler from [BEMHTML](https://en.bem.info/) templates to
    [BH](https://github.com/bem/bh) templates.

    *Author* of [xjst-more](https://github.com/vkz/xjst-more), an
    [XJST](https://github.com/veged/xjst)-based compiler for BEMHTML templates
    that facilitates incremental compilation of templates potentially on the
    Client. WIP.

    *Contributor* to [ometa-js](https://github.com/veged/ometa-js), a JavaScript
    implementation of [OMeta](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OMeta).

    *Contributor* to [bem-xjst](https://github.com/bem/bem-xjst), XJST-based
    compiler for BEMHTML templates.


Emacs Lisp
:   *Author* of [jslime](https://github.com/vkz/jslime), a minor mode that sends
    JavaScript code to Node.js repl - silly little thing with very few features
    that does make iterative JavaScript development in Emacs sane.

    *Contributor* to [projectile](https://github.com/bbatsov/projectile), a tiny
    fix for persp/projectile when used with Helm.

Formal education
----------------
2004–2006
:   [Keldysh Institute of Applied Mathematics](http://keldysh.ru/index.en.shtml) (Moscow, Russia)\
     *PhD track in Applied Mathematics, dropped out*

    \

1999-2004
:   [Lomonosov Moscow State University](http://www.msu.ru/en/info/struct/depts/mechmath.html) (Moscow, Russia)\
    *MS in Theoretical Mechanics and Applied Mathematics.*

Autodidacticisms
----------------

2012
:   [How to Design Programs](http://www.ccs.neu.edu/home/matthias/HtDP2e/index.html)
    by Matthias Felleisen et al.

    How I was introduced to programming. [Assorted solutions to HtDP](https://github.com/vkz/HtDP).

    Brown University

    How I was introduced to creating PLs. Taught by
    [Shriram Krishnamurthi](http://cs.brown.edu/~sk/) based on his wonderful
    [PLAI](http://cs.brown.edu/courses/cs173/2012/book/) text.
    [My solutions](https://github.com/vkz/PLAI) - a sequence of interpreters for
    progressively more complex languages: all the way to OOP, CPS transforms and
    type checkers.

2014
:   [Hardware/Software Interface](https://www.coursera.org/course/hwswinterface), [[Certificate](http://bit.ly/1FBVMks) 89.6%]\
    University of Washington for Coursera

    How I was introduced to systems programming. Essentially an Introduction to
    Computer Systems course as taught at Carnegie Mellon with the same
    course-load and text
    [Computer Systems: A Programmer’s Perspective](http://csapp.cs.cmu.edu/) by
    Bryant and O’Hallaron.

2014

    Université catholique de Louvain for edX

    How I was introduced to concurrency, multi-paradigm programming and
    delightful paradigms that so far seem to exist only in academic setting.
    Taught by [Peter Van Roy](https://www.info.ucl.ac.be/~pvr/cvvanroy.html) and
    is based on his classical
    [Concepts, Techniques, and Models of Computer Programming](https://www.info.ucl.ac.be/~pvr/book).

2015
:   [Introduction to Probability](https://www.edx.org/course/introduction-probability-science-mitx-6-041x-0), [[Certificate](http://bit.ly/1FHykkR) 94%]\
    MIT for edX

    Because it's awesome.

Languages
---------

Russian, English
:   Equally comfortable with both.\

Clojure
:   What I get to use for my current projects.\

Racket
:   Favorite Lisp. Would be my weapon of choice were such choice ever offered.\

JavaScript
:   Fair amount of experience especially writing Node.js backend applications.\

OMeta
:   Extensive experience writing parsers and fairly complex grammars.\

Emacs Lisp
:   Unavoidable Lisp.\

Java
:   Enough to write a Clojure wrapper with necessary bindings and avoid writing more Java.\

C
:   Enough to pass the systems programming class.\

Factor, OCaml, F#
:   Toyed with but never mastered in earnest.

Activities and interests
------------------------

Most of my activities and interests these days involve boxes with lights and
buttons. Even so there were reports of me cycling, bouldering, surfing,
roller-skating, skiing and more. Having owned a sports car I'll choose a bicycle
every time.

Lived in the UK, US, Hungary and far more exotic places. Crossed the US from
Mexico to Canada twice with the current state count of 19.
