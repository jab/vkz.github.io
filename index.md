Corporate ladder
----------------
Since Apr 2017
:   *Programmer* at
    [Droit](http://droitfintech.com/)
    (London, UK)

    Same as before but with obligatory daily commute.

2015-2017
:   *Programmer/Consultant* at
    [Droit](http://droitfintech.com/)
    (New York, USA - remote)

    Building an expert system for compliant trading. Sneaking
    Clojure/ClojureScript into unsuspecting financial giants. On any given day I
    could be designing DSLs, implementing compilers, parsers, rule-based
    engines, putting together simple browser-based GUIs and whatever else the
    startup life would have me do.
    
2014-2015
:   *Programmer* at
    [Yandex](https://company.yandex.com/)
    (Moscow, Russia).

    Officially a member of *Search Interfaces Development Infrastructure* group,
    but mostly I write backend tools that perform source to source compilation:
    parse, transform and generate code. Any given project will inevitably depend
    on: [ometajs](https://github.com/veged/ometa-js),
    [esprima](http://esprima.org/),
    [estraverse](https://github.com/estools/estraverse),
    [uglify-js](https://github.com/mishoo/UglifyJS),
    [escodegen](https://github.com/estools/escodegen),
    [xjst](https://github.com/veged/xjst). If I'm lucky and do it right frontend
    developers get to use my work and get all the credit.

2009-2011
:   *Equity Derivatives & Structured Products Sales* at
    [Renaissance Capital](https://www.rencap.com/InvestmentBanking/About/)
    (Moscow, Russia).

    
2007-2009
:   *EM Structured Solutions and Derivatives Sales* at
    [Barclays Capital](http://investmentbank.barclays.com/markets.html)
    (London, UK).



Projects
--------
Racket
:   *Author* of [ometa-racket](https://github.com/vkz/ometa-racket), a mostly
    complete Racket implementation of
    [OMeta](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OMeta) - OO pattern-matching language
    that extends PEGs with ability to handle left-recursive rules and match
    structured data.

    *Author* of [skish](https://github.com/vkz/skish), a mostly futile attempt at
    porting Olin Shivers' wonderful [scsh](http://scsh.net/) to Racket. scsh is
    a non-interactive Unix shell embedded within Scheme (originally Scheme48).

Clojure
:   *Author* of several closed-source products: FpML message parser,
    financial derivatives classifier based on ISDA taxonomies, legal
    annotation tools, etc.
    
    *Contributor* to [seqexp](https://github.com/cgrand/seqexp/pull/6), regular
    expressions for Clojure sequences.

JavaScript
:   *Author* of [bemhtml-syntax](https://github.com/vkz/bemhtml-syntax), a syntax
    converter for [BEMHTML](https://en.bem.info/) - an XSLT inspired templating
    language - part of [BEM methodology](https://en.bem.info/method/) of
    frontend development.

    *Author* of
    [bemhtml-source-convert](https://github.com/vkz/bemhtml-source-convert), a
    *best effort* compiler from [BEMHTML](https://en.bem.info/) templates to
    [BH](https://github.com/bem/bh) templates.

    *Author* of [xjst-more](https://github.com/vkz/xjst-more), an
    [XJST](https://github.com/veged/xjst)-based compiler for BEMHTML templates
    that facilitates incremental compilation of templates potentially on the
    Client. WIP.

    *Contributor* to [ometa-js](https://github.com/veged/ometa-js), a JavaScript
    implementation of [OMeta](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OMeta).

    *Contributor* to [bem-xjst](https://github.com/bem/bem-xjst), XJST-based
    compiler for BEMHTML templates.

    Brown University

    How I was introduced to creating PLs. Taught by
    [Shriram Krishnamurthi](http://cs.brown.edu/~sk/) based on his wonderful
    [PLAI](http://cs.brown.edu/courses/cs173/2012/book/) text.
    [My solutions](https://github.com/vkz/PLAI) - a sequence of interpreters for
    progressively more complex languages: all the way to OOP, CPS transforms and
    type checkers.

    Computer Systems course as taught at Carnegie Mellon with the same
    course-load and text

    Université catholique de Louvain for edX

    How I was introduced to concurrency, multi-paradigm programming and
    delightful paradigms that so far seem to exist only in academic setting.
    Taught by [Peter Van Roy](https://www.info.ucl.ac.be/~pvr/cvvanroy.html) and
    is based on his classical
    [Concepts, Techniques, and Models of Computer Programming](https://www.info.ucl.ac.be/~pvr/book).

    MIT for edX

    Because it's awesome.

    [The Racket Summer School of Semantics and Languages](https://summer-school.racket-lang.org/2017/) in Salt Lake City, Utah.
    
    While targeted at PL PhDs a bunch of us non-academic types had been
    admitted. Learnt to create languages quickly and back them up with runnable
    reduction semantics - what's not to like?

Languages
---------

Russian, English
:   Equally uncomfortable.\

Clojure
:   What I get to use for my current projects.\

Racket
:   Favorite Lisp. Would be my weapon of choice were such choice ever offered.\

JavaScript
:   Wrote fair amount, mostly backend compiler stuff with Node.js.\

OMeta
:   Extensive experience writing parsers and fairly complex grammars.\

Emacs Lisp
:   Unavoidable Lisp.\

Java
:   Enough to write a Clojure wrapper with necessary bindings.\

C
: Enough to pass a systems programming class but not nearly enough to actually use it.\

Factor, OCaml, Lua
:   Toyed with but never used in earnest.

Activities and interests
------------------------

Most of my activities and interests these days involve boxes with lights and
buttons. Even so there were reports of me cycling, bouldering, surfing,
roller-skating, skiing and more. Having owned a sports car I'll choose a bicycle
every time.

Lived in the UK, US, Hungary, Spain and far more exotic places. Crossed the US from
Mexico to Canada twice with the current state count of 19.
